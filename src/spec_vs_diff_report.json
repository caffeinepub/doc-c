  "summary": "Implemented a new PremiumDoctorProfileDashboard component and wired it into the protected doctor dashboard route with Internet Identity gating and profile setup dialog preserved. The premium layout/hero background and some animation infrastructure are evidenced, but several required UI elements (CTAs, full 3-column contents, map tile/pin, and specific animations) are not fully verifiable from the truncated diff. Generated static image files themselves are not shown as added.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Left column must include circular doctor photo; hospital name; phone; email; location; 5-star rating display; primary blue \"Contact Now\" button; destructive red \"Hire Doctor\" button.",
      "reason": "Avatar and contact fields are partially evidenced, but the diff is truncated before showing the rating UI and the two CTA buttons, so implementation of the 5-star system and required CTAs/colors cannot be confirmed from provided evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/doctor/PremiumDoctorProfileDashboard.tsx (truncated)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-20",
      "requirement": "Center column must include large Doctor Name, specialization, years of experience, skills list, green badge text exactly \"Available Now\", and working hours.",
      "reason": "Dummy data includes these fields, but the rendered center-column UI is not visible in the truncated component content, so the required layout/text (including exact badge text) cannot be confirmed from provided evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/doctor/PremiumDoctorProfileDashboard.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Right column must include About section and a small map preview with a visible location pin indicator.",
      "reason": "The component imports MapPin and includes dummy about text, but the truncated diff does not show any rendered About section or map preview tile/pin UI, so this cannot be confirmed.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/doctor/PremiumDoctorProfileDashboard.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Add smooth animations: profile card fade-in on initial load; buttons scale on hover; star rating animation; availability badge pulse effect.",
      "reason": "Profile card fade-in is evidenced via `animate-fade-in` and Tailwind keyframes, but the truncated diff does not show button hover-scale classes, star-rating animation usage, or a pulsing availability badge in the component markup, so the full set cannot be confirmed.",
      "evidence": [

    {
      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Add required generated static images under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them via /assets/generated/... URLs.",
      "reason": "The dashboard references image URLs under /assets/generated/..., but the diff does not show any new image files added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
